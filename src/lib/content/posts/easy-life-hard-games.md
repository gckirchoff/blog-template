> “It is during the worst times of your life that you will get to see the true colors of the people who say they care for you.”

The purpose of modern life is to reduce, or entirely eliminate, scenarios that would be considered the worst of times. This is of course for the best, but I would like to discuss a potential side effect and its potential solution.

How often are you put into time-critical situations in which hasty thoughts and actions are required to achieve a moving goal that is less a success, and more just the least bad conclusion? For most people in most phases of life, the answer is seldom to never. The severity of the situation I'm describing is not relative, but absolute. We've all had situations where an exam is approaching much faster than desired, forcing us to go through the entire preceding night studying. As the time before the exam shortens, so does our efficiency in acquiring desperately needed information. This sounds (and feels) bad, but is it really? In terms of absolute risk to livelihood as you study, hunched over in your office chair, there is close to nothing. There is no risk of starvation, predation, adverse elemental exposure, or dehydration. Even in the worst circumstance that the exam is completely failed and that exam was required for entrance into a career-critical program, these absolute risks to livelihood only marginally increase.

Say then that a situation appeared that did put our most basic needs at risk. _Emma Suggestion, to give readers some images in their head: A lion appears before you and your child, snarling and licking its jaws. A fire is consuming your apartment building, and you live on the top floor._ How would we act and respond? Would we be efficient? Would we retain the ability to cooperate with others? Could we even succeed?

Given how generally I have described this situation, it's hard to say. What can be said is that we lack practice. _Emma Suggestion- to conclude this introduction, I would either round out with something like "Video games may be the resistance training our mind needs to stay sharp" or just, "We are not evolutionarily adapted to these challenge-less/stagnant times" to connect to the next section. _

# Practice

*Emma Note: I'd start off with something like "The human mind's ability to achieve high cognition was designed under a special set of circumstances that included challenges to our ability to survive, and required our cognitive ability to figure out solutions to these circumstances." *The evolution of higher cognition and learning is not inevitable and is certainly not always advantageous. The advantages of having the capacity to learn are self-evident:

- Response to shifting environmental challenges beyond the body's innate abilities
- Innovation of new techniques
- Cumulative effect of sharing information in social species.

But there do exist some cons:

- Neurons are expensive, developmentally and metabolically. In the average adult human, the brain is 2% of the body's mass, but accounts for 20% of our energy consumption.
- The ability to learn the wrong thing.

The fact that sapient cognition and the capacity to learn has evolved so infrequently among species could be an indication that its emergence would actually be a net negative to their overall fitness. *Emma Suggestion - We should remind the reader why we're talking about the rarity of cognitive intelligence, and why we're going to talk about an animal that loses its brain. A little glue to hold these ideas together.: In fact, there exists an animal species where it *loses* its brain in response to lessening environmental challenges as it grows older.*

A prime example of this is the sea squirt (ascidians). The sea squirt is a fellow member of Chordata and starts its life looking not too dissimilar from a tadpole.

![larval sea squirt](/postImages/easy-life-hard-games/sea-squirt.png)

The larval state has a tail, some basic sensory organs, and a cerebral ganglion, which is the equivalent of the vertebrate brain. This is used for coordinating motor movements in response to sensory stimuli in its motile state. The larva doesn't eat and quickly finds a suitable rock to permanently cement itself in place. It then goes through metamorphosis to become its adult state. The creature overall becomes much simpler as it atrophies its tail, fins, light sensing organs, and significantly reduces its cerebral ganglion in a way that is commonly referred to as "eating its own brain". Because the adult is simpler than the larva, this is referred to as retrogressive metamorphosis.

The reason for this is because it doesn't need much of a brain anymore. Brains are very useful for moving around in advanced ways, but if you don't do that, the brain is just an energetically expensive paperweight.

Now how does this relate to us? The ability to react to dire circumstances requires brain power, but if we don't ever encounter these situations, why develop the brain in the regions that would be responsible for mediating responses to them?

Atrophy and the concept of "use it or lose it" is not foreign to our daily lives. Muscle mass is an intuitive example. If we use a muscle at the gym, its mass increases. Not using the muscle causes it to shrink and atrophy. Similarly, the bone density of astronauts decreases if not properly managed in space. This energetically makes sense because why keep expensive cells and machinery around if there's no reason to? Lifting heavy weights tells your body that lifting heavy weights is an expected part of life and that to do that, larger muscle mass is required. The body won't sporadically decide to hypertrophy our muscles if we keep it in a situation where that is never necessary.

According to [Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/train-your-brain#:~:text=Practicing%20a%20new%20and%20challenging,it%20on%20a%20regular%20basis.) the neuroplasticity of our brains gives it the ability to grow even as we age. This is similar to our muscles in that growth requires regular training and specifically hypertrophies the parts the are involved in completing the challenge. This sounds good, but the flip side of this is that there won't be growth in the areas that aren't trained. _Emma Suggestion: In fact, we can even lose parts of our brain-- just like the sea squirt._

How, then, can we train these lacking areas of the brain?

I argue that we should train the parts of the brain that respond to severely adverse situations. Just as a weightlifter who can bicep curl 30 pounds can easily bicep curl 15 pounds, a brain that can efficiently handle existentially intense situations should easily be able to handle easier ones. My second argument is that we don't, and shouldn't, have to put ourselves in immediate danger to train these parts of the brain.

In his book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman says, with the support of psychologist Daniel Gilbert, that our minds initially attempt to believe all information given to us as true. The mind must first automatically construct the best possible interpretation of a given situation to then be able to interpret it with more conscious effort. They go even further, arguing and later proving that even nonsensical statements evoke initial belief. An example Gilbert provides is, "whitefish eat candy."
The brain's initial response to this statement is to utilize associative memory of your preexisting concepts of whitefish and candy to construct a believable image of a fish eating candy. Later conscious analysis will quickly make you realize that candy is not part of the standard diet of whitefish, but that didn't stop your mind from initially and subconsciously seeing and believing an image of a fish eating candy to be true.

Video games are massive sources of information being fed straight to the brain through the eyes and ears. Much of this information falls into the category of extremely dangerous situations that we don't go through in our day to day lives. This information is all initially perceived as true, just as the previous example describes, but how conscious processes take over splits drastically. When seeing the mental imagery of a fish eating candy, you quickly shake your head and say, "nah, that's not true." When faced with a large alien approaching in a video game, you respond to the stimulus just as you would in real life - you send motor signals to various parts of the body to act out a response, as well as trigger a hormonal response. This information from the video game isn't taken in and disregarded, it is utilized. How could you appropriately respond to such a situation if your brain didn't perceive it as real in some regard?

Therefore, when we play a video game we create a looping system. Information comes in through the senses, it is used to construct a sense of what is going on and is perceived as real, that information is processed and evaluated, then it is acted upon. Those actions will soon bring in new information to start the process again. Every step of this system has an inherent efficiency. How quickly and completely we transform visual stimuli into mental imagery, how we interpret that information, and then how we chose to act on that information. These can be trained to improve their efficiency amd efficacy.

[Diankun Gong et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09763) compared two groups of people, amateur action video game (AVG) players and expert AVG players. Amateurs were those who did not play AVG habitually and had less that one year of experience playing AVGs. The AVG experts were recognized as either regional or national champions in AVG competitions and had AVG training for at least six years. MRI Neural imagery of the study participants was acquired and what it found was that AVG experts had increased functional connectivity between the attentional and sensorimotor networks and increased gray matter volume in insular subregions compared to the amateurs. These regions facilitate attentional and sensorimotor functions. The left insular cortex, for example, is involved in [flexible switching of attention](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6181803/). These enhancements may serve as a neural basis of the improved coordination between attentional and sensorimotor functions in the expert players. Behavioral research corroborates this by showing that experienced AVG players have better attentional and sensorimotor functions than amateurs. Expert AVG players exhibited improved selective attention on the following tasks:

- Flanker compatibility (the ability of the subject to suppress incorrect responses and therefore respond with the correct one)
- Useful field of view
- Enumeration (the number of items the subject can readily attend to)
- attentional blink (the ability to identity the second of two targets when they are shown in quick succession)

What's more is that it appears that playing AVG games induces neural plasticity in the insula, aka improvement akin to muscle growth. This makes sense from a practice perspective given that in a typical AVG game, players may complete approximately 150 sensorimotor responses per minute using the keyboard and mouse. These responses require coordination between attention and sensorimotor functions. From a weight lifting perspective, that's a lot of reps.

Some more support:

- [C.S. Green et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212001303) found that playing video games may enhance the ability to learn new tasks.
- [Training](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18378330/) the brain can induce structural changes in the adult brain. Not about video games, but still proves the point that improvements can occur due to deliberate training in the adult years.
- Building on the last point and bringing it back to video games, even older adults see [benefits](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005416/) to cognitive control from video game training.

_Emma Suggestion: Awesome post! I love how you include a lot of resources and examples for the ideas you're describing. Getting into how gameplay can induce stressful situations and train your brain will be the perfect segway after line 51. I included a few notes about how to glue/cohese(?) your arguments and ideas together, but I didn't find any out-of-place ideas. Some typos, like immergence -> emergence._
