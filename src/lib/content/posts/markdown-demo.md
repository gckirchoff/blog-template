The following is a quick showcase of what you can do with markdown.

This text is on the next line because there is an empty line above it ^
The reason for the extra line is because it would be hard to write/read all
of this in code if it was all in one line. This is written on multiple lines in the file,
but doesn't create any new lines in the post.

If you want more space between lines, write `<br>` (short for linebreak), and leave blank lines above and below it

<br>

To separate text with a line, you can use `----` in the same way as `<br>`

---

You can make text **bold** and _italic_ and even **_bold and italic_**

<br>

The following are the different levels of heading sizes you can use:

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

<br>

## Links:

Clicking on [this](https://www.google.com) link will bring you to google.com

If you want to go to a page on this site, just write the last part of the url.
For example, [this link](/about) will bring you to the about page.

## Lists:

1. It must start with a number
2. All list items must start with a capital letter
